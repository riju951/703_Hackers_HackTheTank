Develop a website builder platform that allows users to easily create websites
without prior coding knowledge, using modern programming languages like
Javascript and with two-dimensional drag-and-drop elements.

Two-Dimensional Drag-and-Drop Elements: The platform should allow users
to easily add and position two-dimensional drag-and-drop elements.
Modern Programming Languages: The platform should be developed using
modern programming languages like Javascript, which provides better
speed and has a large community of developers for support.
Multi-Vendor Marketplace: The platform should serve as the foundation for
a dynamic multi-vendor marketplace, where any user can sign up and build
their websites within a short period of time without any prior coding
knowledge.
User Interface: The platform should provide a user-friendly web interface
that allows users to easily create and customize their websites.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
